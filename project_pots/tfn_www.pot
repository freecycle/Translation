So, please try your darnedest in your piece to be clear about what The Freecycle Network is and what it isn't... for example, it is *not* a place to just go get free stuff for nothing. It *is* a place to give or receive what you have and don't need or what you need and don't have -- a free cycle of giving which keeps stuff out of landfills. That perspective makes all the difference and we have seen a huge difference in the attitudes and participation from new members depending on how The Freecycle Network is portrayed in media pieces, which often result in significant membership spikes for local groups. We are only as good as the sum of our parts so we want to attract good parts, right?"
