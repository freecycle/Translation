So, please try your darnedest in your piece to be clear about what The Freecycle Network is and what it isn't... for example, it is *not* a place to just go get free stuff for nothing. It *is* a place to give or receive what you have and don't need or what you need and don't have -- a free cycle of giving which keeps stuff out of landfills. That perspective makes all the difference and we have seen a huge difference in the attitudes and participation from new members depending on how The Freecycle Network is portrayed in media pieces, which often result in significant membership spikes for local groups.

msgid "The Freecycle Network's current annual budget is running at about $140,000 in income. The funding comes from corporate underwriting, on-site advertising (in the form of a Google sponsor bar), grants and <a href='https://www.freecycle.org/donate' title='donate'>individual donations</a>. Approximately 90% of these funds are used directly for program expenses. The remaining 10% is split evenly between membership, fundraising and other administrative expenses. Our IRS 990s are posted at the hotlink below as well as on Guidestar.com. We are delighted to report that we have now received our 501(c)3 status from the IRS (11/06) and that donations to The Freecycle Network are tax-deductible! We likewise are a charity in the UK. Further, we are registered as a nonprofit corporation in the State of Arizona. Tax deductibility is retroactive to our application date in July of 2004.Members can show support for the mission of the Freecycle Network by <a href='https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=KRKYQ7CC8LB5W' title='Donate'>making a one dollar donation today</a>.</p>"
